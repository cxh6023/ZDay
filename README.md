# ZDay
This application is a game that replicates Call of Duty: Zombies, but in a top-down fashion. 
The vast majority of the sprites are custom and all of the programming is done in GML, 
using GM Studio.

The big chunks of code are in the objects folder and are in the obj_player.object.gmx file and the obj_zombie.object.gmx. There are some other key parts in the scripts directory.

Controls: The classic W, A, S, and D are used to move, with the angle of a player's shot controled via a mouse.
